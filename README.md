Sensorimotor synchronization data analyses

Research data from my work on sensorimotor synchronization, intelligence, 
and musical creativity at the University of New Mexico. 

Tasks were administered using custom Arduino code. 
Output from these tasks was transmitted as CSV text. 
This raw output is cleaned by a Python script included here. 

Code from the analysis process is being revised for clarity.
